# Students App

This program is a simple app that stores courses and students data and can assigns students to a course. It is a simple REST API written in python using Flask.

## REST API

A REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) is a transfer of resources (data) from a Server to a Client over the internet. Through the REST API, the client can perform a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE request on the server.

A client can use an API to request for resources from the server. A server has the resources and transfers it to the client through an API. A resource can be any object for example, user, photo, number. An API allows one software to talk to another. It is a procedure allowing a client to access the data from a server. 

An example of an API is "https://github.com/StephenDsouza90/demo-crud-sqlite-python-app" where:
 
github.com - Endpoint

/StephenDsouza90/demo-crud-sqlite-python-app - Resource in which 

/StephenDsouza90 is the parameter for the github username and /demo-crud-sqlite-python-app is the parameter for the github user's project name

## Flask

Flask is a mirco web framework written in Python.

## The set up

This app runs with the Endpoint localhost (my computer) that has an IP address '0.0.0.0' (which maps to my computer) and a port 8080.
```
localhost:8080
```

In this app, the courses and students data has already been created in the courses_data and students_data objects respectively. The assignment_data object has an empty list through which the client can alter it as required.

### create_app()

The create_app function has the following functions and curl commands.

courses data:

1. Get all courses (GET request)
```
>> curl localhost:8080/courses
```
2. Add a new course (POST request)
```
>> curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -X POST -d "{\"course_id\":\"english\", \"name\":\"English\"}" \
        "localhost:8080/courses"
```
3. Get a particular course (GET request)
```
>> curl -X GET "localhost:8080/courses/math"
```
4. Delete a particular course (DELETE request)
```
>> curl -XDELETE "localhost:8080/courses/math"
```
5. Update a particular course (PUT request)
```
>> curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \
        -d "{\"course_id\":\"math\", \"name\":\"Advance Mathematics\"}" \
        "localhost:8080/courses/finance"
```

students data:

1. Get all students (GET request)
```
>> curl localhost:8080/students
```
2. Add a new student (POST request)
```
>> curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d "{\"student_id\":4, \"name\":\"Ariana\"}" \
        "localhost:8080/students"
```
3. Get a particular student (GET request)
```
>> curl -X GET "localhost:8080/students/1"
```
4. Delete a particular student (DELETE request)
```
>> curl -XDELETE "localhost:8080/students/1"
```
5. Update a particular student (PUT request)
```
>> curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \
        -d "{\"student_id\":4, \"name\":\"Arie\"}" \
        "localhost:8080/students/4"
```

assignments data:

1. Assign a student to a course (POST request) 
```
>> curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d "{\"student_id\":1, \"course_id\":\"math\"}" \
        "localhost:8080/assignments"
```
2. Get all assignments (GET request)
```
>> curl localhost:8080/assignments
```
3. Get courses of a particular student (GET request)
```
>> curl -X GET "localhost:8080/assignments/students/1"
```
4. Get total number of students in a particular course (GET request)
```
>> curl -X GET "localhost:8080/assignments/courses/math"
```
5. Delete a particular student from a course (DELETE request)
```
>> curl -XDELETE "localhost:8080/assignments/courses/math/1"
```

### route

The routing is showed below.

1. /courses for returning data about the courses saved in courses_data data structure
2. /students for returning data about the students saved in students_data data structure 
3. /assignments for returning data about the assignments saved in assignments_data data structure

Some of the routes have an additional parameter.

Example: 

The route for geting a particular course is '/courses/<course_id>'

### method type

The method types are

1. -X GET: Request for viewing a resource 
2. -X POST: Request for adding a resource 
3. -X PUT: Request for updating a resource 
4. -XDELETE: Request for deleting a resource 

### curl command

An example of a curl command is as follows.

Example: 

Curl command for adding a new course to courses_data.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"course_id\":\"english\", \"name\":\"English\"}" "localhost:8080/courses"
```

1. curl: stands for client
2. header: mentioning content type (only for POST or PUT)
3. method: instructions from client to server (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
3. data: for POST or PUT request, the client provides the data in JSON format {key:value, key:value}
5. URL: "localhost:8080/courses" - where the URL is localhost:port/endpoint or host:port/endpoint/parameter (depending on the function) 

### URL and route mapping

The URL maps to the route via the app.routes decorator function which is part of the Flask Library. These functions are then responsible for processing client requests and returning responses.

Route example:
```
'/courses/<course_id>'
```

URL example:
```
"localhost:8080/courses/math"
```
